# This Branch contains Directives of Angular4
* There are three types of directives 
    1.Components—directives with a template.
    2.Structural directives—change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.
    3.Attribute directives—change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.

* Structural Directives change the structure of the view. Two examples are NgFor and NgIf. Learn about them in the Structural Directives guide.

* Attribute directives are used as attributes of elements. The built-in NgStyle directive in the Template Syntax guide, for example, can change several element styles at the same time.

All the Three are covered in this Branch
